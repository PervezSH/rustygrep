# Rustygrep

"A command line tool that interacts with file and command line input/output"

## About The Project

Rustâ€™s speed, safety, single binary output, and cross-platform support make it an ideal language for creating command-line tools, this project is my own version of the classic command-line tool `grep` (globally search a regular expression and print). Implemented only the simplest use case, i.e., it takes a filename and a string as its arguments. Then it reads the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints those lines.
